## 2017
We finished just below midway in the leaderboard of teams that submitted a solution, but it was still a great experience. 

## 2018
Unfortunately this was during a snow storm - we competed remotely and one member could not make it. We finished in the top third of the leaderboard.

## 2020
Placed well, top 5 in Ireland with work colleagues.

## Plan
I had a detailed plan written somewhere, but I can't remember where. Roughly it was like this:

1. Read the brief separately.
2. Discuss it together and formulate ideas.
3. Write the dumbest solution possible, just to get on the leaderboard.
4. Each try your own best idea, likely this code can be used by others anyway.
5. Try to bring the code together into one best solution.
6. For the last bit, scramble together to try bump points by parameter searching etc.
