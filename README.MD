# My hash code files
This contains my C code for the hash code sample pizza problem, and the 2017 video problem

# 2017
In 2017 I competed in hash code with my girlfriend.
We finished just below midway in the leaderboard of teams that submitted a solution, but it was still a great experience. 

# 2018
In 2018 I competed in hash code with three friends from Trinity College Dublin. Unfortunately this was during a snow storm - we competed remotely and one member could not make it. Results remain to be seen.
