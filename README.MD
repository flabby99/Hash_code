# 2017
In 2017 I competed in hash code with my girlfriend, we were 1st in Ireland for a short while following the event. We did not iterate on our code much, and we were eventually overtaken by other groups from Ireland.
Overall our team Questionable Intelligence placed 1947th - this was probably in the top 25% of the qualifier round, which we were pretty pleased with as a two person team.
